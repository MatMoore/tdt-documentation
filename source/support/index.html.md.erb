# Support

## Report issues

Report any problems or issues by:

- contacting the Government Digital Service (GDS) technical writing community on [email][contact-email] or [Slack][slack-ask-tw]
- posting in the [tech docs format][slack-tech-docs-format] Slack channel
- opening an issue on the [tech-docs-template repo][template-issues]

## Contribute

We welcome contributions to the Technical Documentation Template.

You can create an issue or pull request in the following GitHub repos:

- [alphagov/tech-docs-gem][tech-docs-gem]
- [alphagov/tech-docs-template][tech-docs-template]
- [alphagov/tdt-documentation](https://github.com/alphagov/tdt-documentation) - for this documentation

If you're part of the [alphagov GitHub organisation](https://github.com/alphagov) you should have write access to the repos. If you do not have access, ask a GitHub admin or on the [#tech-docs-format Slack channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T8GT9416G/CADK8N58B).

Before you create a pull request, you should:

- check the repo to see if someone has already raised a similar issue or pull request
- test your contribution using [unit tests](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-gem/tree/master/spec/govuk_tech_docs), [JavaScript tests](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-gem/tree/master/spec/javascripts) and [integration tests](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-gem/tree/master/spec/features)
- document the change in this documentation
- add a description of the change to the repo changelog - unless your change only refactors code

The Central Digital and Data Office (CDDO) technical writing team will review your proposal at their next triage session, then do one of the following:

- accept your proposal but ask for changes before it's prioritised for publication
- accept your proposal and find someone to work with you to publish the changes
- not accept your proposal and explain why

## Projects that use the template

You can see [which repos currently use the Tech Docs Template](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-gem/network/dependents) in the Tech Docs Template Ruby gem GitHub repo.
