# Accessibility

The GOV.UK Technical Documentation Template and its documentation are maintained by the technical writing team at the Government Digital Service (GDS).

## Accessibility statement for the Technical Documentation Template documentation website

This accessibility statement applies to the documentation at [https://tdt-documentation.london.cloudapps.digital/](https://tdt-documentation.london.cloudapps.digital/).

This website is run by GDS. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

- change colours, contrast levels and fonts
- zoom in up to 300% without problems
- navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
- navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
- listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.

[AbilityNet](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/) has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

### How accessible this website is

We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible because of [issues caused by our Technical Documentation Template](#using-the-technical-documentation-template-for-your-own-documentation).

### Preparation of this accessibility statement

This statement was prepared on 2 September 2020. It was last reviewed on 2 September 2020.

This website was last tested in May 2020. The test was carried out by the technical writing team at GDS. We used the [WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) and a checklist we created with the help of the GDS accessibility team. We tested all the website's pages.

## Using the Technical Documentation Template for your own documentation

This [Technical Documentation Template](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-template) was last tested in August 2020. The test was carried out by the [Digital Accessibility Centre (DAC)](https://digitalaccessibilitycentre.org/).

DAC tested an example set of documentation pages to cover the different types of content that the Technical Documentation Template allows. They also tested the search functionality that appears on every page in the Technical Documentation Template.

This Technical Documentation Template is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below:

- Some tables in content do not have table row headers when needed. This fails [WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/info-and-relationships.html).

- Some code examples use a colour that has very low contrast with the background colour. This fails [WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.3 Contrast (minimum)](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html).

- Users cannot tab to code examples to scroll them using the keyboard. This fails [WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.1.1 Keyboard](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/keyboard-operation-keyboard-operable.html).

- The search field and the ‘Hide table of contents’ button are not placed logically in the focus order. This fails [WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.3 Focus Order](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2011/WD-UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20-20110310/navigation-mechanisms-focus-order.html).

- Users can focus elements that are hidden visually behind other content, for example when using the search field. This fails [WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.3 Focus Order](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2011/WD-UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20-20110310/navigation-mechanisms-focus-order.html).

- Images link to a new tab without telling users, and do not have link text. This fails [WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.4 Link Purpose (in context)](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-refs.html).

- Some subheadings have links that contain no text. This fails [WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.4 Link Purpose (in context)](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-refs.html).

- The default page header has duplicate links to the service page. This fails [WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.4 Link Purpose (in context)](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-refs.html).

- When a page has a [review banner](/configure_project/page_expiry_and_review/#set-review-date-for-pages), there are duplicate links in the visible and hidden version of the banner. This fails [WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.4 Link Purpose (in context)](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-refs.html).

- The search field does not have a submit button. This fails [WCAG 2.1 success criterion 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/labels-or-instructions.html).

We plan to fix the accessibility issues by the end of 2020.

While GDS takes steps to ensure the Technical Documentation Template is as accessible as possible by default, you still need to carry out contextual research. Using the Technical Documentation Template does not mean your service automatically meets level AA of WCAG 2.1.

You’ll still need to make sure your documentation as a whole meets accessibility requirements. You must research your documentation content to ensure that it’s in context.
